# ProteusNet

Just like its namesake, ProteusNet is a highly versatile network framework for the Unity Engine. Unlike most network frameworks, ProteusNet is not limited to a single network model or the Unity Runtime alone. It allows developers to create their own custom network models, whether server authoritative, distributed authority, or client prediction, and synchronise data even within the Unity Editor without starting the Playmode or a build.
